Edgium
======

Install up-to-date Linux packages with 1 line.



## What is Edgium?

The packages available in our Distros are hopelesly outdated. To install the latest 
version we have to dig deep into Wikis, Docs, Stack Overflow
or some random article/tutorial named "How to install X on [Distro of Choice]".
It gets really time consuming and painful when you have to repeat the process.
<br><br>
Edgium combines all this knowledge in one package.
