Edgium
======

Install up-to-date Linux packages with 1 line.



## Why Edgium?

The packages available in our Distros are hopelesly outdated. To install the latest 
version we have to dig deep into Wikis, Docs, Stack Overflow
or some random article/tutorial named "How to install X on [Distro of Choice]".
It gets really time consuming and painful when you have to repeat the process.
<br><br>
Edgium combines all this knowledge in one package.

## What is Edgium?

Edgium is a small DevOps tool built around Ansible and everything it does is sync
the most popular and regularly updated repository with your 
`yum/repos.d` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`. 


Edgium is heavily inspired by <a href="http://brew.sh">homebrew</a> for 
OSX. The major difference is that **EDGIUM IS NOT A PACKAGE MANAGER** -
it uses the underlying package managers(apt, yum).
